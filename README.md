**Deterministic processes drive wetland plant community composition and diversity**

Contemporary plant communities are simultaneously the reflection of current habitat conditions and historic processes. The observed patterns in the diversity, abundance, and composition of these communities are the result of the combination of stochastic and deterministic processes. Deterministic factors often contribute a greater signal in wetlands where hydroperiod drives, and is also driven by, plant species composition throughout time. We evaluated the effect of edaphic factors on plant community composition and diversity in the Eastern Highland Rim physiographic region of Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alabama. Vegetation was sampled at 17 open wetland sites yielding 416 vascular plant species. Site richness was not correlated with site size and beta diversity did not significantly correlate with geographic distance between sites. Stochasticity as measured by Raup-Crick values was higher in unstable sites with high degrees of water fluctuation, low early season water depth, and grazing present. Finally, hydrological factors were found to significantly impact both site richness and beta diversity. This suggests that at hydrologically stable sites, deterministic factors play a large part in determining Eastern Highland Rim wetland plant community assemblage and diversity.

**Repository Description Notes:**
This repository contains data associated with a master's thesis by C.M. Ciafre as well as code for preliminary analyses. Note that Site 15 does not exist in the data; this was done intentionally as this site is not independent from Site 14.
