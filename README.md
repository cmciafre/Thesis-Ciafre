**Deterministic processes drive wetland plant community composition and diversity**

Contemporary plant communities are simultaneously the reflection of current habitat conditions and historic processes. The observed patterns are the result a combination of stochastic and deterministic processes. The latter is often more important in wetlands, where hydroperiod drives, and is also driven by, plant species composition throughout time. We evaluated the effect of edaphic factors on plant community composition and diversity in the Eastern Highland Rim physiographic region of Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alabama. Twenty-seven open wetlands were subsampled with 1 m<sup>2</sup> quadrats and cluster analysis identified 9 vegetation types which were correlated primarily with water depth and land use history. Site-level diversity indices were negatively correlated with site size and positively correlated with seasonal water depth change. This suggests the increased influence deterministic processes have over stochastic processes  on Eastern Highland Rim wetland plant community assemblage.

**Repository Description Notes:**
This repository contains data associated with a master's thesis by C.M. Ciafre as well as code for preliminary analyses. Note that Site 15 does not exist in the data; this was done intentionally as this site is not independent from Site 14.
