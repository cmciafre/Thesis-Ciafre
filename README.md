Deterministic processes drive wetland plant community composition and diversity

Contemporary plant communities are simultaneously the reflection of current habitat conditions and historic patterns. These patterns are the result of either stochastic or deterministic processes. The latter is often the case in wetlands, where hydroperiod both drives and is driven by plant species composition throughout time. We evaluated the effect of edaphic variables on plant composition and diversity in the Eastern Highland Rim physiographic region of Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alabama. Twenty seven open wetlands were subsampled with 1 m^2 quadrats to identify plant community composition. Cluster analysis identified 9 vegetation types which were correlated primarily with water depth and land use history. Site-level diversity indices were negatively-correlated with site size and positively-correlated with seasonal water depth change. This suggests the increased influence determinisitc processes have over stochastic processes in Eastern Highland Rim wetland plant community assemblage.

Repository Description Notes:
This repository contains data associated with a master's thesis by C.M. Ciafre as well as code for preliminary analyses. Note that Site 15 does not exist in the data; this was done intentionally as this site is not independent from Site 14.
